S086 ,57, male ,18,there's POSTCLITIC a little girl . and a little boy standing on top of a stool . and it looks like a mother maybe washing the dishes in the kitchen . there's POSTCLITIC cookies in the jar up in the pantry I suppose . there's POSTCLITIC two cups and a saucer or a plate maybe . there's POSTCLITIC some shrubs outside . the sink is overflowing right now . and that's POSTCLITIC about all . the sink is overflowing . the sink is overflowing . he's POSTCLITIC trying to kill himself . you want more ? that's POSTCLITIC it ?,1

S092 ,74, female ,15,the little boy is up on this thing here . and he's POSTCLITIC up trying to get something out_of the garden selection I think it is . the little girl I think is mad because she didn't POSTCLITIC get some of it . and here's POSTCLITIC mama drying the dishes . no just the little girl and the boy was on here . the little girl and the boy . she's POSTCLITIC reaching up to the boy and the boy got his other hand down . so ... it looks color /. no that's POSTCLITIC all . oh she spilled something I think . from the sink down . it came splashing down . that's POSTCLITIC the first I noticed it .

S093 ,68, female ,25,well the children are climbing up and he's POSTCLITIC about to fall . and he's POSTCLITIC getting cookies . and she's POSTCLITIC telling him to sh be quiet so mother won't POSTCLITIC hear him getting up there . and he's POSTCLITIC handing a cookie down to her . she's POSTCLITIC washing the dishes . and for some reason she must have been upset about something because she is letting the water run out all over the place . I can't POSTCLITIC believe she's POSTCLITIC upset about the kids because she hasn't POSTCLITIC seen them . maybe she did turn and look at them and then go back to the dishes . in other words it's POSTCLITIC ... she's POSTCLITIC deciding that if she did see them she's POSTCLITIC deciding that she's POSTCLITIC going to let them go ahead with it . but I don't POSTCLITIC think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling . I think she would have turned . maybe dropped her dish . but she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from being harmed in the fall . and he might just pull all the cookie jar with him when he falls too . and with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor it would be a sad /. threesome and the kitchen would be a mess .,1
S094 ,64, female ,17,oh yes . a little girl and the little boy is getting cookies out_of the jar . oh and the stool is upsetting . and I guess it's POSTCLITIC the mother is drying dishes . water's POSTCLITIC spilling down all over the sink . water on the floor . little boy's gonna POSTCLITIC fall and that there stool .
