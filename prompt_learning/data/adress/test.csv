S165 ,64,0,1,15,"yeah I see the woman's in a kitchen . and /. now it looks like she's ... I can't really pick it out but ... oh and there's a little girl here talking and a little boy I assume on this side here . and this is a stool here or some kind of a chair . and I don't know what this is here . I can't see what that is . oh there's another . did I talk about this girl up here ? she's ... I can't see too plain what she's doing . oh yes I think so . where was she ? this girl ? I really can't see what she's doing . no I don't . yeah , that's awfully hard for me to distinguish ."
S166 ,73,1,0,29,"oh it's the same picture . you should give me a different one . why ? it would be more fun if you had some variety . okay . we have here a scene in a kitchen and it looks as though that's a mama who is working at the sink and her two children . and the two children are hoping that mama will not notice because she's looking out the window that they are getting into the cookie jar . so the boy climbs up on a stool to reach the cookie jar . and as he's getting up there the stool is tilting and he looks as though he were about to fall over . and the little girl is telling him to be quiet by putting her finger on her lips . he has one cookie in his hand , is reaching for another one . the lid is off the cookie jar . the cupboard door is open . he's supposedly going to hand one cookie , it looks as though he is , to his sister and grab another one for himself but I doubt that he's gonna get all that done before the stool falls over . around the corner of the kitchen there's a counter that sort_of turns a corner . there are cupboards below the counter and above the counter where the cookies are . then when you get over and have turned a corner in the kitchen you have base cabinets and then you have a window above that which is looking out into something which makes it looks as though it's summer outside because the window is open . there are things growing out there . there's a walk . there's some shrubbery underneath another window that looks it's in a another wing of the house . there's a tree beyond . there are tie back curtains at the window . the mother is working at the sink and the faucet is left on and apparently there's no overflow in the sink so it's overflowing right onto the floor splash . and she has on a sleeveless dress which also indicates that it's summer . and it looks though she has an apron on . she has short hair . she is drying a plate with a tea towel . beside the sink there are two cups and a plate . looks as though there's some suds and some dishes in the sink . and two faucets with x type handles one on either side and a center faucet . she has shoes on with no ties , just sort of slipon shoes . there's a little scallop valance across the top of the curtains . I think that's all I'm gonna tell you . well �?the handles on the door are the kind that are just almost like a round piece of wood that you hafta get a hold of to pull the cupboard door open . and what's really strange is that you can't see any handles on the cupboards on the other side of the kitchen ."
S167 ,65,0,1,28,"the poor mom's getting her feet wet because she thinking of days gone by and then the water run . and that boy whether he knows or not he's gonna crack his head on the back of that counter trying to get too many cookies out . I don't know the significance of that little girl putting her hand to her mouth reaching . unless that's the way all silly girls act at that age . pardon ? oh sure . there's no handles on the cabinet drawers under the counter on the left side . and over in the window you see through the kitchen window all the styles are not in the glass . and if the kitchen window's the same type of window as well the other part of the house the style's only in the upper and the laterals . maybe they build them that way . no , but I did notice that's a_little I wouldn't say unusual but . pardon ? I said that the sink was overflowing . the mother's getting her feet wet . the boy's going to fall very hard and hurt himself . and nobody's gonna help him . well happening ... did I say the cabinet doors where the kids are have no handles on them ? oh �?there's got to be a dozen other things . responsible ? well I'll tell you the way mom is looking there's not much going on in her head . she's thinking of dad . and the little girl is saying ""/. sh don't tell mom . the conflict's in what she's thinking whereas she didn't know the kids are behind her . and did I say ..? . the cabinet doors are different sizes . have no handles . I guess you take a big sledge hammer to that ."
