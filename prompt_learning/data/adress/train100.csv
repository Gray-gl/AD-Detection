S086 ,57, male ,18,there's POSTCLITIC a little girl . and a little boy standing on top of a stool . and it looks like a mother maybe washing the dishes in the kitchen . there's POSTCLITIC cookies in the jar up in the pantry I suppose . there's POSTCLITIC two cups and a saucer or a plate maybe . there's POSTCLITIC some shrubs outside . the sink is overflowing right now . and that's POSTCLITIC about all . the sink is overflowing . the sink is overflowing . he's POSTCLITIC trying to kill himself . you want more ? that's POSTCLITIC it ?,1

I can't POSTCLITIC believe she's POSTCLITIC upset about the kids because she hasn't POSTCLITIC seen them . maybe she did turn and look at them and then go back to the dishes . in other words it's POSTCLITIC ... she's POSTCLITIC deciding that if she did see them she's POSTCLITIC deciding that she's POSTCLITIC going to let them go ahead with it . but I don't POSTCLITIC think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling . I think she would have turned . maybe dropped her dish . but she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from being harmed in the fall . and he might just pull all the cookie jar with him when he falls too . and with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor it would be a sad /. threesome and the kitchen would be a mess .,1
