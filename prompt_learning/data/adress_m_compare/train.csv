adrso002,70,1,0," Okay, I see a mom doing the dishes and the water's overflowing from the sink and she seems to be completely oblivious of it. The children in the picture, who I presume are hers, are climbing. The boy is climbing on a, or standing on a stool that's about to fall over, putting his hand in the cookie jar on the top shelf, and his sister or cousin or whoever the girl is, is reaching up for a cookie. The window is open, there's a pathway with garden on either side it looks like. There's something else on the sink, I mean on the countertop, dishes. And that's, the mother has an apron on, she is dressed in the Mrs. Beaver style with an apron and a nice dress and shoes and so forth. And I don't understand why she's not turning the water off, but that's part of the deal. And there's curtains on the window, and there's panes in the window, small panes. And that's about it.","The image depicts a scene inside a kitchen. There is a woman standing near the sink, washing dishes. Next to her, on the countertop, there's a cat lying down, possibly sleeping or just resting. In the background, there are two children.

adrso003,72,1,0," Starting from the left, I see two children standing on a tipping stool, reaching for the cookie jar. The boy is up on the top of the stool, obviously getting the cookies for his younger sister. Mom is washing the dishes while the sink is overflowing, or doing the dishes. I'm not really sure what's going on out there, out on the other side of the window. There's some dishes there on the sink that remain to be done.","The image depicts a scene inside a kitchen.

She's got a frown on her face. Walking in the puddle of water that's coming out of the sink, that's reallyâ€?no, it doesn't look like a terribly organized way of life here in this kitchen. Of course, the boy is going to fall on the ground and crash with some of the cookies will also come out onto the ground. There's something going on outside.

She's not looking at the kids who are getting into the cookie jar, and the young boy is about of course to topple over because the stools tipping but why the water is overflowing in the sink I have no idea she seems so serene and yet so out of it okay Not paying attention really to what's going on.

She must be blind, but that's her doing. Also, the kid is about to fall, having unsuccessfully gotten a cookie out of the cookie jar. That's the boy who's up on a stool, and the daughter is there trying to grab the cookie, I guess, from the boy. What else? It looks like a nice yard in back with a bit of a garden and some grass, I believe. She's standing in the water. It still bothers me that she's gone blind, that she can't, well, she'll feel it soon on her feet when the water hits her. Oh, that's what I see.","The image depicts a scene inside a kitchen.

Maybe she's just the caretaker or the babysitter, and maybe that would give her a reason for being a little disengaged here. But at any rate, the boy is about to have an accident. He may very well pull the whole cookie jar down with him. And this woman is oblivious to the fact that the sink is running over. As soon as it gets ankle deep, I think she'll wake up. And when she hears the crash, she definitely will be brought to the present. Otherwise, it looks like a beautiful day outside.

The cabinet's here. Can you see anything else going on here? It seems like there's water splattered over. Isn't that out of the sink? Isn't that water? And I see a big plate and a couple of saucers lying. And I don't know about the curtains. The curtains got different, something made there. She must have one of those double aprons back in front, isn't it? And the kids are at the cookie jar. Okay? Yeah. Okay.","The image depicts a scene inside a kitchen.

It was summertime and mother and the children were working in the kitchen. The window was open and there was a slight breeze blowing in. Mother was daydreaming and forgot and left the water in the sink running and it was overflowing. The children were hungry, and because they knew mother was distracted doing the dishes, they did something they probably should not have done. They got the kitchen stool, moved it under the cupboard where the cookie jar was, and the young boy climbed up to get a cookie. Because he did not place his weight correctly on the stool, he's about to fall. He's probably hurting himself because his head's going to hit the kitchen cupboards. It looks like the house is set in the country. It's a large house. Either that or you're seeing another house or a wing of the house, this grass growing, a little path. That's good. Mother looks pretty laid back there.","The image depicts a scene inside a kitchen. There is a woman standing near the sink, washing dishes.

He's handing another one to the little girl. The little girl is shushing, whatever you call that, the boy, because evidently they're stealing them, and sneaking them is a better word, and they're, you said happening, a verb, it has to be movement. Just everything that you see going on in the picture? Including identifying things. What happened? The lady is standing in a puddle of water and the faucet is running and the window is open and there's a house next door with curtains at the window, the same kind of curtain as hers.

It doesn't start in the ground, it starts in the air uh there's a shrub between the two yards there are two cups on the counter, one plate. That's fine. The stool is crooked. He's going to fall over because it's a three, it's a tripod stool that is falling over, not very steady.

He's standing on the stool and tipping over and looks like he's about ready to fall. The woman in the sink looks like she's wiping a dish with a rag in her hand, holding the dish with the other hand, and water's flowing into the sink and over the sink. It looks like she's not paying attention to it. Water's just flowing out of the sink and all over the floor, and she's stepping into the water too.

adrso276,73,1,0," Oh, it's the same picture. You should give me a different one. We're afraid to. Why? It would be more fun if you had some variety. That's probably true. Okay. We have here a scene in the kitchen, and it looks as though that's a mama who is working at the sink and her two children. And the two children are hoping that mama will not notice because she's looking out the window that they are getting into the cookie jar. So the boy climbs up on a stool to reach the cookie jar and as he's getting up there the stool is tilting and he looks as though he were about to fall over. And the little girl is telling him to be quiet by putting her finger on her lips. He has one cookie in his hand, is reaching for another one. The lid is off the cookie jar. The cupboard door is open. He's supposedly going to hand one cookie, it looks as though he is, to his sister and grab another one for himself. But I doubt that he's going to get all that done before the stool falls over. The other, around the corner of the kitchen, there's a counter that sort of turns a corner. There are cupboards below the counter and above the counter where the cookies are. Then when you get over and have turned a corner in the kitchen, you have base cabinets and then you have a window above that, which is looking out into something which makes it look as though it's summer outside because the window is open there are things growing out there there's a walk there's a some shrubbery underneath another window that looks it's in another wing of the house. There's a tree beyond. There are tied-back curtains at the window. The mother is working at the sink, and the faucet is left on, and apparently there's no overflow in the sink sink so it's overflowing right onto the floor splice splice. And she has on a sleeveless dress which also indicates that it's summer. It looks as though she has an apron on. She has short hair. She is drying a dish with a tea towel, a plate with a tea towel. Beside the sink there are two cups and a plate. Looks as though there are some suds and some dishes in the sink there are two cups and a plate looks as though there's some suds and some dishes in the sink and two faucets with X type handles one on either side and the center faucet she has shoes on with no, just sort of slip-on shoes. There's a little scalloped valance across the top of the curtains. Hmm. I think that's all I'm going to tell you. Well, the handles on the door are the kind that are just almost like a round piece of wood that you have to get a hold of to pull the cupboard door open.

The kids are after the cookies, and the little boy is going to hurt himself really badly. And the mother is in not too good a shape either, because there's water spilling out of the sink and her feet are going to get wet. She could slip. She could break the dishes. She could really hurt herself. The little girl, I think she's safe enough, though it looks like she's a little worried. It's a beautiful day, windows are open, the curtains areâ€”well, it's not too windy because the curtain seems to be in place. Other than that, it seems a very sweet home.
