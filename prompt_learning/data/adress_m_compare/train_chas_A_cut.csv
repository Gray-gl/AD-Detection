0,adrso002," Okay, I see a mom doing the dishes and the water's overflowing from the sink and she seems to be completely oblivious of it. The children in the picture, who I presume are hers, are climbing. The boy is climbing on a, or standing on a stool that's about to fall over, putting his hand in the cookie jar on the top shelf, and his sister or cousin or whoever the girl is, is reaching up for a cookie. The window is open, there's a pathway with garden on either side it looks like. There's something else on the sink, I mean on the countertop, dishes. And that's, the mother has an apron on, she is dressed in the Mrs. Beaver style with an apron and a nice dress and shoes and so forth. And I don't understand why she's not turning the water off, but that's part of the deal. And there's curtains on the window, and there's panes in the window, small panes. And that's about it",0,70
1,adrso003," Starting from the left, I see two children standing on a tipping stool, reaching for the cookie jar. The boy is up on the top of the stool, obviously getting the cookies for his younger sister. Mom is washing the dishes while the sink is overflowing, or doing the dishes. I'm not really sure what's going on out there, out on the other side of the window. There's some dishes there on the sink that remain to be done",0,72
2,adrso004," I see a little boy almost falling on a stool, trying to get in the cookie jar with his sister beside him, looking for hers. Mother's washing the dishes and spilling the water. That's about it. It's a nice window off the sink",0,74
3,adrso005," Oh my, such a mess, and that sink is overflowing. And I don't know why, she's trying, not even caring. She meaning the wife or mother, while the kids are, one of the kids is falling off the stool. Big accident momentarily. It's, possibly she's looking out of the window. She looks unhappy. She's got a frown on her face. Walking in the puddle of water that's coming out of the sink, that's reallyâ€” no, it doesn't look like a terribly organized way of life here in this kitchen. Of course, the boy is going to fall on the ground and crash with some of the cookies will also come out onto the ground. There's something going on outside. Nothing serious, though, just the rest of the house and a sidewalk. That's about all",0,67
4,adrso006," Well, the kids are trying to get the cookies, and the boy is on a stool of some kind, ready to fall off, as he hands his sister the cookie. And the mother must be daydreaming or in a fog or something, because the water is running over the sink as she's drying the dish. It looks like it's probably a nice day. I think maybe the window might be open. It looks like a nice house. It looks like they have sufficient income. You want me to go on?",0,65
5,adrso007," Our mother standing by the sink, kind of looks like lost in thought, wiping a dish. The sink is overflowing with water. She doesn't seem too concerned. A boy is on a stool that's about to tip over. He's in the cookie jar. His sister's got her hand up, reached, waiting for a cookie. And the mother seems oblivious to what they're doing",0,62
6,adrso009," Okay, this is a family setting in a kitchen, and the mother is washing dishes, and the sink is overflowing with water and falling onto the floor. And there's two children after the cookie jar, high up in the cabinet, and the little boy is on the stool, which is falling over. And that's basically what I see. The window is open, looks like a nice day, but there's a couple disasters going on here, all at the same time",0,68
7,adrso010," Let's see, Mama appears to be busy doing the dishes. Wow, she's had a problem. The sink is running over. And meanwhile, while she's distracted, the son and daughter are off into the cookie jar. And, horrors, he's about to fall",0,72
8,adrso011," What do I see in this picture? This reminds me probably of when I was very young. Okay, mom is washing the dishes. I don't know why. She's not looking at the kids who are getting into the cookie jar, and the young boy is about of course to topple over because the stools tipping but why the water is overflowing in the sink I have no idea she seems so serene and yet so out of it okay Not paying attention really to what's going on. And that's what I see in that picture. Overlooking a backyard of course, which is neat. You should always have the window in the kitchen",0,71
9,adrso012," Well, I see a kitchen and a housewife or homemaker at the sink, and her two kids are having a great time. She is drying a dish as her sink overflows. She must be blind, but that's her doing. Also, the kid is about to fall, having unsuccessfully gotten a cookie out of the cookie jar. That's the boy who's up on a stool, and the daughter is there trying to grab the cookie, I guess, from the boy. What else? It looks like a nice yard in back with a bit of a garden and some grass, I believe. She's standing in the water. It still bothers me that she's gone blind, that she can't, well, she'll feel it soon on her feet when the water hits her. Oh, that's what I see",0,68
10,adrso014," I see a woman who has zoned out. She's in a world of her own, obviously. She isn't aware of what's going on. Her son obviously is caught. Maybe it's not her son. Maybe she's just the caretaker or the babysitter, and maybe that would give her a reason for being a little disengaged here. But at any rate, the boy is about to have an accident. He may very well pull the whole cookie jar down with him. And this woman is oblivious to the fact that the sink is running over. As soon as it gets ankle deep, I think she'll wake up. And when she hears the crash, she definitely will be brought to the present. Otherwise, it looks like a beautiful day outside. Is there anything else I should say about this picture?",0,68
11,adrso015," Okay. I'm going to show you some pictures, okay? Here's a picture. Tell me everything that you see going on in this picture. Okay, Mom is washing dishes, but the sink is running over with water. The little boy is trying to get cookies on the step stool that's fallen and the sister doesn't care about the step stool falling when she wants the cookies. And she's got the window open, which is very unusual. And there are dishes on the counter. That's about it. You're talking about action stuff? Anything like overall picture, anything that you see happening? It's like a big picture. They're close to, I wonder if that's part of their house or if it's their next door neighbor. Hmm. best part of their house or if it's their next door neighbor. Could be a walk to the garage or it could be a next door neighbor",0,65
12,adrso017," Alright, we have a few more tasks to go through before we break for today. Okay. So, here's a picture. Just tell me everything that you see going on in this picture. Well, there's a guy up in the tree and the dog is barking at the guy. Oh, whoops, I'm sorry. I gave you the wrong one. That was my fault. That was my fault. Okay. Alright. Yeah, tell me what's going on in this picture. I see a boy robbing a Alright. Yeah, tell me what's going on in this picture. I see a boy robbing the cookie jar and apparently his sister wanting a cookie, but he's about to have an accident in the process of robbing the cookie jar. And I see the mother washing dishes and the sink overflowing because she has the water on and the sink is full and she must have the stopper in place uh... she may be in danger of slipping since there's water on the floor. And the boys, it looks like, I think I said that already, I think the boys are about to have an accident so okay",0,65
13,adrso018," Just look at this one and tell me everything you see going on. Mom ain't having a good day. She's not having a good day at all. The kids are in the cookie jar. She's not having a good day at all. The kids are in the cookie jar. And the, not the ladder, but the high chair is turning over. She's preoccupied with him, even though she's not looking at him. She forgot to turn her water off and her sink is overflowing, getting her floor wet. And her daughter, the little boy's sister, she's just laughing. She's having a ball. She's enjoying every minute of this. But at the same time, she wanted a cookie before you fall. It's just kind of a chaotic day for her. But she seems to have a smile on her face. I guess she said, well, it's all in the day. I just deal with it as it comes. All right. Thank you",0,66
14,adrso020," Okay, I see that the sink is running over and the lady is standing there washing the plate. And I see the little boy up on the ladder, up on the, it's not a ladder, it's a stool. And he's falling off, reaching for a cookie in the cookie jar. And the little girl is standing by him, holding her hand up, reaching for the cookie",0,61
15,adrso023," Tell me everything you see going on in this picture. This one? Yes, ma'am. Oh, a little boy fixing a flaw off a stool, trying to get a cookie for his sister, I guess. And then the mother's washing dishes and her sink is running over him. And she's washing dishes and drying. Do you see anything else going on? I mean there are no right or wrong answers. I just want to be straight with you. No. Just the water spilling in the floor and the little boy and girl. He's fixing to fall. Trying to get the cookies. I didn't see anything going on outside. Yeah. Great. Thank you very much",0,67
16,adrso024," Here's a cookie jar and the lid is off the cooking jar. The boy is about to come down on the floor. And the girl uh... uh... but anyway, the housewife was in the kitchen and the sink is overflowing. The girl may be saying, say, ha ha ha, I told you so, or something like that. I guess this must be the wife although it might not be because maybe that was an apron and maybe this was the um There is... This should be a window. There. The upper one is there. As a pathway we don't know where the pathway is going to because we can't see it and looks like there's some flowers in the bushes or something like that. And here are some draperies. Well this one on this side is, I don't see it the other side, but I suspect it would be the same thing there and uh the i guess i said that the water was coming down on the floor. I don't know the... Here are two cup cup cups for coffee or something like that and that's fine. Okay, thank you very much indeed",1,56
17,adrso025," Tell me everything that's going on. We're grading, they are going to get some some cookies from the cookie jar and the mother does not see it because she's inside drying the clothes and the kids then just, I guess, there's a picture that the mother is working hard and the kids were playing and all of a sudden somebody stepped in and turned over a dish all over the floor, except that it did not dry up. It didn't splash from the, it splashed from the sink, but not from the, no, that's not, I'm trying to get too much out of one. That's okay. Is there anything else? One of the kids is going to get a crack on the head. Sometimes I see it very clearly and other times I see a weak image, so to speak, and sometimes I just have this . What is it? Well, is there anything else that you can think of? Mostly, I have not so much trouble in looking at that thing as an image, but not getting any of the orange, orange is, that you would see. Uh-huh. Was there anything else in that picture you want to tell me or do you think you've told me everything? Okay, thank you. Alright",1,66
18,adrso031," What do you see going on? Well, the boy's on the ladder, and the ladder's tipped over. Not a ladder, just steps there. And, uh, he's gone. From what I can see, he's going to upset the cookies. And the sink is falling over on the floor, while the mother, I guess, is drying the dishes. But I'm telling you, I wouldn't want to be on that stepstool. It's not even a stepstool, it's just a stool. Anything else going on? The water is overflowing on the floor. Okay. There's probably some more water on that, this one, but I'm not too sure. Anything else? I'm trying to figure out what this is out here. Okay, well that's fine",1,79
19,adrso032," What's going on in the patient? Well, the children are climbing up and he's about to fall and he's getting cookies. And she's telling him to be quiet so no one will hear him getting up there. He's had a creepy-down tour. She's washing the dishes and for some reason she must have been upset about something because she's letting the water run all over the place. I can't believe she's upset about the kids because she hasn't seen them. Maybe she did turn and look out and go back to the dishes. In other words, it's a... She's deciding that... If she did see them, she's deciding that she's going to let them go ahead with it. But I don't think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling. I think she would have turned and maybe dropped her dish, but she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from falling. And he might just pull all the cookie jar in when he falls too. And with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor, it would be a sad threesome. And the kids would be in this. Med. Three-simmer. And kicks in with the others. Okay, great!",1,68
20,adrso033," What's going on in the picture? In here? I really don't know because I haven't gotten things turned up. Yeah. Right. Have a look at the picture, see if you can tell me what's going on. Not in this one. What is it? This is the kind of thing that whoever . What is it that's happening here? She's cleaning. And what are they doing? Yeah, it's falling down a lot",1,77
21,adrso035," Okay, here's the picture. Tell me all of the action. I'll tell you what's going on in the picture. Oh boy. Well, the little boy's reaching for a cookie. His stool's falling over. And the little girl is begging him to give her one. And she's pointing to her mouse, she won't see it. And Mama is doing the dishes. And the water's running over this thing. It's a mess. And she's not even looking at me. Drawing dishes. She's not even looking at me. Drawing dishes. And she's looking out the window. Nice yard out there. Two cups and a dish finished. This is Cindy. You're busy, huh? Yeah. Okay, I'm sorry I didn't let you in there. Okay, I'm sorry I didn't let you in there. Okay, I'll come back. Anything else? No, that looks pretty good. Okay? Okay, good",1,74
22,adrso036," Tell me what's going on? All the action. What's going on in this picture? Oh, the boy is up, trying a cake, and the woman's sink is running over. Mm-hmm. And these are curtains. And his stool is tumbling over. Mm-hmm. Anything else going on in the house? The school is tumbling over. Anything else going on in the picture? Anything else wrong with the picture? Going on. Any more action in the picture. Okay",1,79

They're writing a cookie jar. Here. And what's this woman doing? This one is... He's cleaning a plate. And what's happening here? so Is that everything? She drops the plate, I guess. Is that everything now? You can do one. Is that everything you see?",1,77
24,adrso038," Here's the picture. Well, the mother's washing the dishes and the water's running out of the sink. Can you see anything else going on in that picture? Yeah, he's standing on a stool and he's going to fall. Okay. Anything else? That's all. i can see she wants a cookie and the stool's falling over Okay, good",1,65
25,adrso039," The table seems falling. The sink is running over. We also need some for cooking. We'll need to dry in a dish. Cup and saucers. It's been almost an hour. I didn't hit this button. Can you see anything else? Well, yeah, I hear something outside. A window. A garden, I guess. Okay? Good",1,74
26,adrso041," What's going on in the picture? Can you tell me the action going on in the picture? Let's see, yes, yes, yes. What's going on in the picture? Tell me all of the action about the picture. What's going on in that picture? Oh, the cow and the little boy. Mm-hmm. What else is going on? The little cow and the little boy. What else is going on?

27,adrso042," Keep going on. Seeing the mother, she's washing dishes and the water's running all over the floor. And the water's running all over the floor, and the boy, he's reaching up for cookies, and his ladder slipped from underneath him, and I guess he's going to have an accident. And the little girl, she's waiting for the cookies, but I don't think she's going to get them because the boy's falling down",1,69
28,adrso043," Have a look at that picture and tell me everything that you see going on in that picture, all the action. What's happening there? Boy in the cookie jar. I'm sorry? Boy in a cookie jar.

Okay, good. Okay, good. Okay, good",1,77
29,adrso044," What do you see going on in the picture? The mother is drying the plate. The water is running on the floor, running in the sink. The kids are taking cookies from the cookie jar and on the high chair that sister, I suppose, the little girl, the little boy is taking the cookies in the little drawers. He's handing them to her. And I'd be there eating them too because I like cookies. I'd be, my hand is always in the cookies. My hand is always in the cookie jar. And the mother is drying the dishes. At the sink. The water is running over. And she's not paying any never minds to it I guess. The floor is getting wet, she'll have to get a mop to mop it up. How about over here? Is there anything else going on over here? Well, the chair is, the kid's going to fall from the stool, the high stool, and stumping over, and he's going to land on his rear end pretty soon. There might be a couple cookies in his hand, probably the cookie jar still too. He might catch that with them to the floor. Yeah. Okay. That's about all. Okay. The sink is running over. The water's dripping on the floor, all over the floor. The old lady will have to floor, all over the floor. The only way you'll have to get a mop and mop up the floor, too, after she's been with the boys for the day",1,77
30,adrso045," This picture. And tell me everything that you see going on in that picture. What's happening there? The water? Uh-huh. What about it? Well, let's see. There's something has to be where the water goes down over. Probably something that they don't have it open, or something, I don't know. When the water goes down, what do you call that? This here. Right here. This. What do you call that? What is that? What would you call that? I don't know. That's what I'm saying i i don't know what that is i i i would call that the u-pipe is that what a u-pipe the u-bend no it's just's just a pipe. A pipe. Oh, oh, oh. Water pipe. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay, well then maybe the water pipe is broke, or not broke, but there must be things in there that the water will not go down. So what's happening to the water? What's happening to the water? What's happening to the water? What's happening to the water? Well, the water is going down in the... What would you call this? On the floor? Floor, floor, floor. Yeah, okay, okay. And what's happening over this side of the picture then? What's happening over here? Well, down on this side of the picture. Well, this thing here is turning over. Uh-huh. Yeah. Can you tell me what's going on there? No, I don't know what's going on. Well, he's probably getting, what's this here, cocoa jar. What's this cocoa? Say it again. Can you read it again for me?

Well, the boy is giving him the girl, the Coco,",1,61
31,adrso046," It's not real clear, so do what you can with it. Do you see anything going on? Yeah, I see the woman's in the kitchen. Okay. Yeah, looks like she's... I can't really pick it up. Oh, and there's a little girl here talking, and a little boy, I assume, on this side here. And this is a high chair here, or some kind of a chair. I don't know what this is here. I can't see what that is. Oh, there's another. Did I talk about this girl? Yeah. What's she doing? She's... I can't see too plain what she's doing. No? Let me try this. Is it a little clear? Oh yes, I think so. Okay, can you see what she's doing now? Where was she at the beginning? This girl? Okay, what's she doing? I really can't see what she's doing. How about, can you see what's going on over there? No, I don't. That's awfully hard for me to distinguish. Mm-hmm. Okay",1,64

And he's trying to reach it to her, but he's falling. He's falling out. He is. Anything else? Let me see. Let me see. There's a water speaker there running. Pardon? There's a water speaker there running. And the curtains, curtains, and the shades, cups, plates, door, closet doors. Okay",1,68
33,adrso049," And there's the picture. All the action that you can see. There's a little boy climbing up in some cookies like the cookie jar. And his little sister reaching for some. And the little boy standing on a ladder. And his big sister washing the dishes at the same time. Big sis washing the dishes and she got dishes sitting on the sink. I think she's running water. Can you tell me anything else that's going on over there? Like I said, the little sister's reaching, Johnny, he's up on the ladder getting some cookies and reaching up, reaching up after him. Anything? He's passing him down to her. Okay, anything else? And the ladder, the ladder about to turn over. Anything else going on over here? The cups, which she didn't wash them, she got them sitting on the sink. Uh-huh. And maybe running water on the sink, and guy, he got a crazy pull that you might get some light in there. And the dishes, the dishes are stacked up. They might be on this table. Anything else? That would be about all right. Okay, good",1,58
34,adrso054," What's happening in that picture? What's happening there? Thank you. okay What else is shining on us. Okay, let me lift it up a little bit. Does that help? What's going on there? You don't have to read it, just look at the picture. This drain was not ours. Is it? Yes. Can you see what's going on here? Everything is cooking and cooking. Uh-huh Okay. Anything else? What's happening over here? She's doing her dishes. What else is happening? There's a light that's falling off. That stool is on. Okay. And the bar is flashing on the floor and she doesn't know it. Mm-hmm Okay. Okay, very good. Thank you",1,60
35,adrso055," What do you see going on in that picture? Oh, yeah. Kids climbing up on the stool, reaching up in the cupboard. They aren't going to knock things off. And the mother, oh boy, the water's all spilling out of the sink. She's just looking at it like, oh, for goodness sakes. Anything else? Well, as I say that, you know, the boy on the stand, or on that stool, when it's tilting, it's a good way to break his neck, break his back, I should have said. The woman left her faucet running, and it rolled over the floor. That's bad enough for me to do. Is that it? Let me scan it a little bit more Oh, is there more in the time? No, no, that's all. Is that it? Yeah. Okay",1,65
36,adrso056," Just tell me what's happening in the picture. Poor mom. Mom's getting her wet feet wet because she's thinking of days gone by and then the water runs. And that boy, whether he knows it or not, is going to crack his head on the back of I don't know if this is a half reaching. so . Anything else? Pardon? Anything else? Oh sure. There's no handles on the cabinet drawers under the counter on the left side. Over in the, the one you see through the kitchen window, all the styles are not in the glass. And if the kitchen window is the same type of window as the other windows of the Apothecary House, they have styles only in the upper part of the house. I didn't notice that's a room. I wouldn't say I knew . Okay, anything else that's actually happening? Pardon? Anything else that's going on in the picture? I see the sink was overflowing. That's right. OK. The water's going to get my feet wet. The water's going to fall very hard. I'm going to hurt myself. And nobody's going to help me. I'm not happy. Did I say the cabinet doors where the kids are have no handles on them? It's just what's going on? I'll tell you the way Mama's looked, there's not much going on in her head. She's thinking of Dad. Okay. And the little girl is saying, shhh, don't tell mom. And the conference goes on. What she's thinking about, she doesn't even know the kids are behind her. And did I say... Okay. Okay. The cabinet doors under the sink are different sizes. Okay",1,65
37,adrso059," In the picture. Oh ho, ho ho. Well, it's kind of calamity, isn't it? The mother is, I assume this is the mother, and she's washing, trying to wash the dishes and the water's overflowing. And the little boy's trying to get cookies out of the cookie jar on top of the cupboard, and his stool is getting right under him, and she keeps holding her hand up, waiting for another cookie. Mm-hmm. Okay, that's good",1,67
38,adrso060," What's going on in the picture? Doesn't it say cookie honey? You just tell me what you see going on in the picture. Oh, cookie jar? This chair is sitting, do I tell you that too? Filted chair. Girl doing dishes. Filling water. Here's two plates now, what would I say about them? Just tell me what you see going on in the picture. Water spilling. Spooky jar. cookie jar, chair falling, and children. You know, this is a damn dumb thing. Okay, that's fine. Let me take it away",1,75
39,adrso062, I'd like you to tell me all of the action that you see going on in that picture. The boys come to a stool and it's going to upset he's trying to get a cookie. And a sink is running over. Mother's drying a dish. And the little girl is reaching up for coffee. Yes. . . bridge Okay,1,69
40,adrso063, Can you see the picture here? Tell me what's going on in that picture. What's happening there? Just tell me what you see happening in the picture. Oh. And there you see There's a cookie jar. And a boy is toppling off a stool and the mother is filling the water and the Thank you,1,57
41,adrso064," Tell me what you see going on in this picture. I don't see nothing. It's like somebody took some pencils or something and went up and down those things. Can you see what's going on in that picture? Oh, I see a girl standing there or something. Okay. Tell me what else you see. Some little dots What else you see? Some little knots or something on there. All over, a lot of it around here there's something else over there. There's another girl. What else do you see going on in the picture?

And he's about to hand her a cookie, but in a few moments it's going to be like total catastrophe. The reason the water's flowing out of the sink is because the water is running furiously. And I'm looking out through the window and I don't see anything going on out there. Unless... That's just a bush, I'm presuming, or a plum pudding. Um, I told you the stool was about to go over. And in a moment there's going to be real chaos, which will make what's going on in the picture look like nothing. The cookie jar is full, the lid is off the cookie jar.

Mother was daydreaming and forgot and left the water in the sink running and it was overflowing. The children were hungry, and because they knew mother was distracted doing the dishes, they did something they probably should not have done. They got the kitchen stool, moved it under the cupboard where the cookie jar was, and the young boy climbed up to get a cookie. Because he did not place his weight correctly on the stool, he's about to fall. He's probably hurting himself because his head's going to hit the kitchen cupboards. It looks like the house is set in the country. It's a large house. Either that or you're seeing another house or a wing of the house, this grass growing, a little path. That's good. Mother looks pretty laid back there",0,61
137,adrso257," Just look at the picture and tell me everything that you see. Somebody's getting cookies out of the cookie jar, standing by the store, the store's got a tip on it. A girl's standing, she's standing up with somebody here, and the other's down there. um The plates are sitting on the counter. You look out the window and see the shrubbery. The lid's sideways from the cookie jar. The door's open and the can open. Um, and they apparently just came to notice me. . Thank you",0,62
138,adrso258," Just everything that is going on there. Oh, for God's sake. The lady is wiping dishes. The sink is overflowing. The, uh, boy is getting a cookie. He's handing another one to the little girl. The little girl is shushing, whatever you call that, the boy, because evidently they're stealing them, and sneaking them is a better word, and they're, you said happening, a verb, it has to be movement. Just everything that you see going on in the picture? Including identifying things. What happened? The lady is standing in a puddle of water and the faucet is running and the window is open and there's a house next door with curtains at the window, the same kind of curtain as hers. And there's a tree in the next yard. It almost looks like it doesn't have a trunk. It doesn't start in the ground, it starts in the air uh there's a shrub between the two yards there are two cups on the counter, one plate. That's fine. The stool is crooked. He's going to fall over because it's a three, it's a tripod stool that is falling over, not very steady. The cupboards don't have handles except one door, and the bottom ones do, and the ones on the left have a different kind of handle. And can I quit pretty soon? Yes, that's fine",0,66
139,adrso259," Okay, that's a picture. Okay. Alright, the mother's washing the dishes and the sink is overflowing. She has some of them dried already on the side as she's looking out the window. The little boy is falling off the stool as he's getting into the cookie jar to give to his little sister who's reaching up to get the cookie also. There's water all over the floor and there's the garden is outside and the mother's not paying any attention to what they do. The stool is tipping, the cookie jar, the door is open, there may be a little breeze coming in because this window is open. The little girl is saying, has her finger to her mouth, shh, we won't tell mother while you give me the cookie. It's in the water and she's probably so engrossed in what she's doing outside she neither knows what the children are doing nor is she paying any attention if the water is overflowing? Okay, good",0,74
140,adrso260," Okay, and you can begin right there. Well, the little boy's on a step stool, trying to reach the cookie jar, and it's falling, and the girl is reaching for a cookie he has in his hand. Mama's washing dishes and the sink's running over. It's just drying a plate and the sink is running over down on the floor. The window is up. And, is that all? You want something else? Anything else? Is there anything else? Well, there's a plate with two cups on the counter. calendar. Is that enough? That's fine. That's good",0,74
141,adrso261," A boy with a cookie in his one hand and his hand in the cookie jar, standing on a stool which is tipping over. The little girl's got her hand up for one, and I don't know what the hand means to the mouth. Does it mean she wants to eat? The kitchen sink is running over, the water running out. It's on the floor. The mother is trying the dishes. Frowning, but not turning off the faucet. Uh... Two cups on the counter. Plate. Another steamer in the middle of the water. Curtains to windows. Lids falling off the book as well. Covered with sand. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you",0,55
142,adrso263," Okay, there's the picture. Everything you can do. Do you mean mishaps? Or whatever? Yeah. Uh-huh. Do you want me to start at any particular time? Mm-hmm. You can start now. Well, top left, cookie being removed from the cookie jar. Handing cookie to sister. About to upend on the three-legged stool. Mother drying dishes, sink overflowing onto the floor. You want action type thing. Yeah. I said drying dishes. Water is flowing. Mm-hmm. It doesn't have a lot to do with it. Okay, good. And the action type thing. Yeah. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and do that. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and do that",0,56
143,adrso265," Now you just look at the picture and just tell me everything that's going on. Okay? This is going to be like looking at those artistic things in Italy when we get there. We're going to be at her dishwashers. Her dish sink is overflowing on the floor because the faucet is running. And she's standing in it yet. Her kiddos are robbing the jar and the little boy is falling off the stool. He's getting some cookies though. And the girl doesn't have those yet. I don't think the perspective on the corner is quite right in the room. How many dishes? Two cups and a plate on the counter. And she's drying a plate. And you have a pretty view out there. And then you see the wing of the house, the living room, the path around the house. And the landscaping is bushes up close and you know, like coffee other things and stuff. Outside there's grass and the land and there's a tree and I think it's... Okay. Could you repeat to me what you said over there? Yeah. He's getting cookies out of the cookie jar. He's falling off the stool. He's got two cookies already. He's giving one to his sister and he's going to have one. Even if he falls, he's going to have his cookies. She has her finger up to her mouth. I know that she's saying, sure, I want one too. I don't know how the mother can be so unaware. Okay, that's fine. Thank you",0,69
144,adrso266," Tell me everything that you see happening. Then I'll tell you. The girl is watching the boy go into the cooking jar. He has a cooking with hand. He's on the stool. The stool is falling. Your mother is drying dishes. Has a plate in her hand. Sink is overflowing, there's water on the floor. She's stepping in the water. Something that's going on, you said. Mm-hmm. The little girl looks like she's motioning to the boy, we call it. I don't know. The woman is looking out the window. Okay",0,63
145,adrso268," Here's the picture. Alrighty, the action I see is a little girl with her finger up to her mouth and one arm extended up, looking up at the boy who's reaching up to the cookie jar. With his right hand he's reaching for a cookie, with his left hand he already has a cookie. It almost looks like the girl's trying to reach for the cookie and the lower left hand. He's standing on the stool and tipping over and looks like he's about ready to fall. The woman in the sink looks like she's wiping a dish with a rag in her hand, holding the dish with the other hand, and water's flowing into the sink and over the sink. It looks like she's not paying attention to it. Water's just flowing out of the sink and all over the floor, and she's stepping into the water too. So, so, and that's part of action in a ranch in our south of New York. Um, Okay, good",0,56
146,adrso269," And there's the picture. The boy's falling off a stool. The lid is falling off a cookie jar. He's grabbing a cookie in his hand. The girl is reaching up. She's touching her nose. I just take care of it on the other side. The other side, the mother's washing dishes, the sink is running over. Her feet's getting wet. And she's looking out the window. That'd be pretty difficult to look out of the window and get your feet getting wet at the same time. That's the way it looks. Okay. Okay? Okay",0,58
147,adrso272," All right, here's the picture. All of the action you can see there. All of the action? Well, the little boy is going to fall off the stool. He's getting a cookie. Do you want me to go slower? No, you go ahead. Okay, the little girl is asking for a cookie. The mother is drying dishes and the sink is overflowing with water. She's getting water all over the floor. Let me see I can't see anything else as far as action goes. Is there more? No, that's fine. Thank you. All right. Thank you",0,62
148,adrso273," There's, um, the two children are in the process of stealing cookies from the cookie jar. And the little girl has her finger up to her mouth to be quiet. And the stool on which the boy is standing is about to fall. And the mother must be looking at the window because the sink is spilling over with water, overflowing with water. Meanwhile, she's drying the dishes. And the water has fallen down onto the floor. And it's a nice day. The wind is up it looks like and it's a nice day outside. That's about all I can say on that",0,67
149,adrso275," Okay, water running out of the sink. Lady drying the plate. A child getting cookies out of a cookie jar. Standing on a stool that is tipping over. A little girl reaching up for a cookie. And curtains at the window, a path outside, a tree, a window into another room. Strawberry. Grass. Let's get back to the room again. There's a cup, two cups, and a plate sitting on the countertop. Cupboards. cupboards the lady has an apron on dress The lady has an apron on, dress, slippers. The boy has on a short-sleeved shirt, short pants, socks, shoes, walk her eyes on her dress, socks. on dress socks scratch slippers . sink, faucet with water running out of it, an open window behind her. Sink. Tobacco curtains. That's all I see. I'm going to go to bed now. I'm going to sleep. Okay. Bye",0,67
150,adrso276," Oh, it's the same picture. You should give me a different one. We're afraid to. Why? It would be more fun if you had some variety. That's probably true. Okay. We have here a scene in the kitchen, and it looks as though that's a mama who is working at the sink and her two children. And the two children are hoping that mama will not notice because she's looking out the window that they are getting into the cookie jar. So the boy climbs up on a stool to reach the cookie jar and as he's getting up there the stool is tilting and he looks as though he were about to fall over. And the little girl is telling him to be quiet by putting her finger on her lips. He has one cookie in his hand, is reaching for another one. The lid is off the cookie jar. The cupboard door is open. He's supposedly going to hand one cookie, it looks as though he is, to his sister and grab another one for himself. But I doubt that he's going to get all that done before the stool falls over. The other, around the corner of the kitchen, there's a counter that sort of turns a corner. There are cupboards below the counter and above the counter where the cookies are. Then when you get over and have turned a corner in the kitchen, you have base cabinets and then you have a window above that, which is looking out into something which makes it look as though it's summer outside because the window is open there are things growing out there there's a walk there's a some shrubbery underneath another window that looks it's in another wing of the house. There's a tree beyond. There are tied-back curtains at the window. The mother is working at the sink, and the faucet is left on, and apparently there's no overflow in the sink sink so it's overflowing right onto the floor splice splice. And she has on a sleeveless dress which also indicates that it's summer. It looks as though she has an apron on. She has short hair. She is drying a dish with a tea towel, a plate with a tea towel. Beside the sink there are two cups and a plate.",0,73
151,adrso277," Now I'm going to show you a picture that has a lot of action going on in it. What I need you to do is to tell me all of the action you see going on in the picture. Okay? And here's the picture. Tell me all the action. . Just tell me all the action out loud. I'll put the picture away? No, you can look at it. Oh, okay. One of the boys on the stool getting cookies from the cookie jar and giving them to the girl, but the stool is about ready to tip over. The mother is drying the dishes, and the sink faucet has filled the sink bowl and is running over onto the floor that's all the action i see Oh, sure. Okay, good",0,78
152,adrso278," Any action or anything you see that's going on? Oh, well, the sinks overflowing, the ladies washing dishes, the boys up on the stools, he's falling, he's getting cookies out of the cooking. The girls are reaching up for the cookies. The windows open. The doors open to the cabinet. That's about it",0,64
153,adrso279," Here's the picture. Washing dishes, or wiping dishes. The water's running over the sink. The kid is stealing the cookies, he's falling over on the stool, the wind is blowing outside the window. The girl is saying be quiet, looking for another cookie. She's standing in a puddle. She's thinking deeply about something, I don't know what. That's my doll, I see. That's it. Okay. Good",0,59
154,adrso281," There's a cookie jar on the shelf and a little boy is up on a stool and the stool is about to fall. He's about to fall, the stool's about to turn over. Little girl in the picture's reaching for the cookie. Mother is washing dishes. The water's running and running over onto the floor. She has a plate in her hand and a towel she's drawing. Two cups are sitting on a counter and also a plate. You can see out through the kitchen window to another part of the house and a walkway away from the house. You can see a window across in the other part of the house, a roof, a tree, there are curtains our curtains on the window. I think that's it",0,68
155,adrso283," There's the picture. Doesn't matter where you start then, right? Alright, there's a little boy on a step stool which is tilted and he's getting some cookies. Now do you want descriptive as far as the cookie lids or how they are or just the action? Just the action. Just the action. Okay, and it looks like he's trying to hand a cookie to his sister. She kind of has her finger up towards her mouth or something. Like she might be giggling. The mother's drying dishes, but the water is overflowing tilt the sink. Now would you recall the cup and the saucers, that's not action, right, is it? No, you don't need to mention it. The breeze might be blowing, the curtains look like they might be. I don't see anything else. I just see the outdoors, but I don't see anything moving. That's about it. I guess that's it for the next video",0,58
156,adrso284," The little girl is saying, be quiet, because we don't want mother to know we're in a cookie jar. The boy is getting cookies and he's going to have an accident because the stool is going to go quite off. The mother is in dream world somewhere because she's drying dishes and the water is coming all over the floor. She's standing in the water even my goodness sakes Hmm. I guess you could look out the window and see that. I don't know Karen. Okay, that's fine",0,56
157,adrso285," Touching lip, raising arm. Is that what you mean? Reaching for cookie, handing cookie down, slipping from stool, stool falling over, wiping dishes, water running, water overflowing, breeze, I don't know if that's an action. Stepping out from water. I guess that's it. Okay. Good",0,66
158,adrso286," Tell me everything that you see going on in the picture. Just tell me what's happening there. Well, for one thing this boy is on his stool getting cookies. His stool is about to fall. And the little girl is reaching for some cookies. She's got a finger in her mouth. Mother's drying dishes, and water's running over. She's drying dishes, water's running over, she's standing in the water. There's a sink there, plate, and a cup. Outside, you can see outside there, the walkway, the edges, the window, the trees. You know, outside the cookery job would have to be undercover. And there's a, what you call it, a con around in the kitchen. That's in the curtains and the window. Okay. Right",0,73
159,adrso287," What do you see going on in the picture? Okay, the kid on the bench who's got his hand in the cookie jar and he's falling off. His sister wants one. His mother is standing in a puddle of water because she didn't turn off the faucet and she's trying to dry a dish, she ought to dry her feet instead. The window is open, water sink is overflowing. It's obviously summer because the window, as I said, was open. There's supposedly leaves on the trees. Anything else that I'm supposed to pick up? That's fine. You just know anything can come out of it, and it's gone on the picture. Well, the kid's going to fall off, and Petey killed. The litter's off the cookie jar. He's got one in his hand, and handing it to his sister, and one is sneaking another one. Not sneaking. The water is still running in the sink. And splashing on the floor. Okay, that's good",0,73
160,adrso289," And that's the picture. Climbing, dishwashing, pointing, stealing cookies. The wind is blowing outside. You can see the grass moving a little bit. The water is flowing. The stool is tipping. The cupboard door is open., curtains are apart but that's not an action, so much delicious. Stepping, the two of them are stepping. Motion of the hands hands pointing in the emotion on the lips reaching. The cookie jar lid is falling. The door is splashing. Okay, that's fine",0,79
161,adrso290," Everything that I see going on. Okay, well, the little boy is stealing a cookie from the cookie jar. He's also handing a cookie from the cookie jar. He's also handing a cookie with his left hand to the girl. He's also falling off the stool, or the stool is tipping over. The little girl is reaching for the cookie and at the same time she's picking her nose or something. I don't know what she's doing. Um It looks like maybe the lid is falling from the cookie jar, I'm not sure. The lady is wiping a plate while the sink overflows. She's standing in a puddle of water. Am I going too fast? No. The tape is going. And she's looking out the window. I can't make out anything in particular going on outside. The faucet's turned on, of course, which is causing the sink to overflow. And the water is splashing on the floor. That's really about all I can tell going on, so to speak",0,57
162,adrso291," What I'd like you to do here is take a look at this picture and tell me everything that you see happening, everything that you see going on. Do I start? Mm-hmm. The children are getting into the cookie jar, which is on the high above the sink. They have the lid off the cookie jar. The boy has two in his hand, and the girl is reaching up for them, and the stool in which he stands is about to upset. Of course, the door is open to get the cookie jar. The mother, presumably, is at the sink washing dishes, the sink is running over the water splashing down on the floor. There are two, I suppose, dry is on the sink. She has one in her hand, a plate that she is drying. She has it on an apron. She's standing by. The sink is below a window with a path out into a garden. There's shrubbery to the left of the path, and you can see beyond that another window, and I don't know what that is, whether those are flowers or weeds. And oh, this is part of the house. You can see the roof of maybe all of the house and the curtains. That's about all the house and the curtains. That's about all the curtains are drawn back",0,66
163,adrso292," Let's see. Children are getting cookies. The storm is going to fall. The sink is overflowing. Mothers wishing her drying dishes. The girl was putting her finger up to her mouth. Like I said, the mother doesn't know. They took the lid off the cookie jar. They opened the door. That's all I'm going to say",0,65
164,adrso293," Water's pouring out of the sink, and the woman is washing dishes. The child is on a stool falling off as he's reaching for the cookie jar with his right hand and trying to hand the other cookies to the little girl who's reaching up with her left hand to get the cookie and her right hand looks like she's almost trying to get the cookie and her right hand looks like she's almost trying to make a signal of silence so the mother doesn't hear it. The mother's feet are in the water as it's pouring on the floor and the window is open you can see a yard outside there's a dish and cups on the sink and the curtains are pulled back so you can see out the window the cupboard doors open and they're all fully dressed and they have sort of a nondescript expression on their face. The woman has her mouth open a little bit. Each one of them has their mouths open a little bit. And, um, I don't know. I don't And that's about it",0,57
165,adrso294, the little boy is reaching for a cookie and he's falling at the same time because the stool has tipped over his little sister is reaching for a cookie and I think beginning to laugh because he's falling the sink is running over and putting water on the floor while the mother is trying to dry the dishes the window is open and the curtains are blowing the breeze coming in from outside the water is running in the sink that's why it's overflowing. I also believe that the mother is daydreaming possibly worrying about something that's it that's all,0,63
166,adrso295," There is a boy on the stool. The stool is tipping over. The boy is taking cookies out of the jar. The cupboard is open. The girl is saying, putting her finger to her mouth and also putting her hand out for a cookie. The mother is washing dishes. Water is spilling over from the sink onto the floor. And the window is open. the drapes are open, there's two cups and a saucer on the sink, and she is stepping on the water on the floor, and she is drying the dishes, and she is looking outside at the clouds, at the shrubbery.

And there's a lady standing in the water. Okay, that's it. That's fine",0,68
168,adrso299," I want you to take a look at this picture, and I want you to tell me everything that's happening there. Everything that's going on in that picture. Okay, is there a number of things? I mean, do I have to come up with a certain amount? No, just whatever you see happening there. Okay. Number one, the boy's stealing some cookies and he's falling over from the chair that's not sitting straight and the sink is overflowing. You want to know everything that's wrong with the picture? Everything that's happening. Everything that's happening. Okay. It looks like it's a nice summer day outside. The lady's drying the dishes and everything that's happening. She's standing in the water, very proud of her. The girl seems to be giggling. Looks like the mother is a little P.O.ed. The girl seems to be giggling. Looks like the mother is a little P.O.ed. Is that all I can see? Okay, fine. That's good. Thank you very much",0,64
169,adrso300," Okay, there's a child reaching for a cookie. The chair is tilted. The girl is possibly moving her finger towards her mouth and reaching for a cookie. Water is running out of the sink and mother's somebody's going to be screaming at a kid boss i know there's action that one was standing in water that's about all I'll say",0,64
170,adrso301," I'd like you to tell me all the things you see going on in the picture. Okay, the water's running out of the sink, overflowing. The mother's doing the dishes. The boy is falling off the stool, stealing the cookies out of the cookie jar. The young lady is holding her hand up, ready to receive one of the cookies. There is a cup and a saucer on the sink board. And there's the drapes on the kitchen, the curtains on the kitchen, and the cabinets all around the sink and the top cabinets. The door is open and the cookie jar is in the cabinet. The boy is up there reaching for it and it looks like he's going to fall off of the stool. And outside is a nice garden with a path leading around the house and bushes and shrubs and grass growing around. She has a dish towel in her hand, drying one of the dishes. And she has a hairdo. She's wearing an apron, and the kids were wearing shoes and she's wearing shoes and the water's dripping on the floor. What else do you want to know? That's fine",0,71
171,adrso302," We'll start with the girl. She's going to the ECO cookie. Her brother is taking cookies out of a jar. And he got careless. She's asking him for one, so he's handing one down to her. In the meantime, he is getting ready to fall off of a stool, a three-legged stool. And the mother's not paying much attention. She's looking out the window. And in looking out the window, why, she's letting her sink run over in the water, splashing on the floor all over her. Okay. And... The one that's present now. Who came right before him? Right before him was Carter. Right before him? The outside looks alright. Wait, wait, I'm mixed up. You've got fire. She's drying a dish and she has two cups and a plate on the table. Well, I did say she was letting the water run down onto the floor, splashing onto her feet. Oh boy. Then there's an angle here that is incomplete of the corner where it all comes together. I'm going to give you two words, and I still want you to use them in a very simple sentence. Child and hospital. I'm going to a hospital in Philadelphia to see my child. There's a plate, two cups. Oh, I did say she's letting the water run over the sink, didn't I? Yes. Cold and winter. She seems to be looking out the window while she's drying her dish. Well, it's... How about that?",0,65
172,adrso303," There it is. Okay, the picture is in a kitchen with a family, a mother and a son and daughter. And the son is up in the cookie jar the cupboard door is open he's getting cookies from the jar he's standing on a stool which is in the process of toppling over. The little girl is holding out her hand for a cookie and she also has her finger to her lips shushing him so he doesn't make any noise. The mother seems to be oblivious to what's going on. She's standing there wiping the dish and the tap water running the sink is overflowing down onto the floor and she's standing in a puddle. Look outside and the curtains are open and see what looks like could be a garage or an extension of the house shrubbery path tree going back in the kitchen on the counter beside her is another plate and low socks and he's wearing shorts and a short sleeve shirt. Histis was wearing what amounts to sort of a mini dress, mini skirt with sandals. And ruffled curtains at the window that are drawn back by drawdrapes. And the cupboards all have recessed handles. Well, no, they're not recessed. At first glance they're recessed, but actually they protrude out from the doors. And also copyright 1972. Okay, thank you",0,66
173,adrso304," Okay, the boy is standing on a stool that is tilting over. He's reaching for cookies in a cookie jar and his sister is standing beside him reaching up for some of the cookies. standing right near them, washing dishes, and the sink, the water is running into the sink, and the sink is flooding over with water. And you want scenery description or anything like that? Where do you see town hall? Outside the window where the mother is, there's a walkway. It looks like it's going out to a garage. And also on this kitchen sink area there's like a coffee cup, two cups and a plate. And... Okay, and I did say that the stool was tilting up",0,70
174,adrso307," The girl's making fun of the boy, she made fun of him so much while he was stealing a cookie out of the cookie jar. And it made him trip. And he's going to follow the mother, who's listening to the kids. She's drying dishes. She'll get the window open and get some air. She isn't paying attention to the sink. The sink's spilling water onto the floor. It's getting her feet wet. The curtains are open to allow fresh air to come in the house. There's two cups in the dish on the sink. And the faucets are open and the cupboard door is open. Looks like it might be rubber doors open. Uh, looks like it might be some spring or summer because things look like they're growing outside. She has shoes on, she has shoes on, he has shoes on, she has shoes on, she has dress, dress, apron, shirt, shorts, socks, socks. The lid's, the cookie jar there's a fancy sink cabinet over here and a fancy wall cabinet over there. That's about it. Okay, good",0,70
175,adrso308," It's a kitchen scene. The mother is doing the dishes. The children are trying to get into the cookie jar. The stool is falling over. The water is running over in the sink. It looks as though the window is open and there is grass and what have you, grass and trees outside. Looks like the curtains might be billowing a little. The little girl is asking the boy for a cookie. And let's see, the mother's drying the dishes. And... dishes and she's standing in the water. Looks like there are a couple dishes that have already been dried sitting on the sink. I guess that's all I see. Hey, what's going on over here? Pardon me? Tell me this again. I might have missed something. Oh, I said the little boy's trying to get some cookies out of the cookie jar, and the little girl's asking for a cookie, and the stool looks as though it's going to fall over",0,68
176,adrso309," Tell me everything that's going on in there. Mother is drying the dishes, looking out the window, not paying attention that the water is spilling all over the floor in the sink. The window is open. The children are behind mother stealing cookies out of the cookie jar. And the boy has climbed up on the stool which is tipping over. He's getting cookies out of the cookie jar, handing them to his sister. His shoes are untied, he's going to fall. The cupboard door is open, the lid is off the cookie jar. Mother's feet are getting wet. She must be in outer space that she doesn't notice all this that's going on. Okay, thanks",0,54
177,adrso312," What do you see going on in that picture? Oh, I see the sink is running over. I see the stool is tipping over. The little boy is trying to get cookies out. The little girl is reaching to get a cookie. The mother is drying dishes. The window is open. I said she's washing. oh she's drying dishes now. And she's standing in the water. The cupboard door is open. There's a cookie jar. And they're just leaning against the cookie jar. I can see the grass and some shrubbery outside and the house next door. Kitchen cabinets. Is that it? Mm-hmm. I see three people in there, a mother and a little boy and a girl. Okay. Is that it?",0,67
178,adrso313, This boy is about to fall off the stool. The mother is washing dishes and the water is spilling over on the kitchen floor. The wind is blowing the curtains the little girl is laughing at her brother who's taking a cookie out of the cookie jar that's it,0,63
179,adrso314, I'm going to show you a picture. And in the picture there's some things going on. What I want you to do is just look at the picture and describe to me any action you see taking place or anything you see happening. The kids are swiping some cookies there and the stool is upsetting. And the girl is telling him to be quiet so his mother is over there washing dishes and the sink is overflowing and the window's up and I don't see much more than that. She's drying dishes. You say action? Right. I'm about there. Cookie jar lids falling,0,61
180,adrso315," Just the action in there. Well, the girl is reaching for a cookie that the boy is trying to get for her while he's... Am I going too fast? Go ahead. While he's falling off a ladder and the mother is washing dishes, drying a plate, while the sink is spilling over with water that has overflown from the spigot that is still running, the water is signaling to be quiet, not to let the mother know that the boy drying the dish with the towel. And the water's splashing on the floor",0,58
181,adrso317," Here's a picture. Alright. The little girl's reaching up there and she's got her finger to her lips. And the boy's on a stool, standing on a stool, but it's going to fall pretty soon. He's reaching for cookies. And the mother has her back to him. She doesn't see them but her. She hasn't paid any attention to her sink. It's running all over the place. Her window is open and there's a nice garden and a garage out back. She's drying some dishes, she has an apron on, her dress is sleeveless, has a couple cups and she has a couple plates, but she better mop up that floor. The little girl has socks and shoes on and a short dress and long hair, medium long hair. And the boy has his shorts on, short sleeved shirt, so it must be summer. Trees are in bloom outside and the flowers out there. Okay. out there. Okay, that's fine",0,77
