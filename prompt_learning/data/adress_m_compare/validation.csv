adrso008,67,1,0," Well, I see what seems to be a mother, or it could be a babysitter with two children, a boy and a girl. The kids are after the cookies, and the little boy is going to hurt himself really badly. And the mother is in not too good a shape either, because there's water spilling out of the sink and her feet are going to get wet. She could slip. She could break the dishes. She could really hurt herself. The little girl, I think she's safe enough, though it looks like she's a little worried. It's a beautiful day, windows are open, the curtains areâ€”well, it's not too windy because the curtain seems to be in place. Other than that, it seems a very sweet home. And probably a little, a few years ago, not right now."
adrso013,70,1,0," Well, the young boy is reaching for a cookie jar. He stood on a stool. He lost his balance. He is about to fall. His sister is not going to get the cookie she was anticipating. The mother was thinking about something else because she let the water overflow. And there are two dirty dishes and two cups."
adrso016,63,1,0," Hmm, a lot of fall and safety problems. So this boy is getting cookies from a cookie jar and the stool is tipping. I'm not sure what his sister is doing. I think she just wants a cookie. But the mother's not paying attention to the water falling out of the sink and she's drawing dishes so I'm not sure and she's cleaning the water and there's a nice window but I don't see anything much else going on. Great, thank you."
adrso019,71,1,0," Okay. Little boy is on a stool that looks like he's going to fall. He's going to the cookie jar and the stool looks like it's going to fall over because it's like bending and a little girl is pointing and he's handing her a cookie. And mom is drying the dishes and all the water is coming out of the sink, overflowing. And she's not paying attention to that. She's looking straight instead of looking at what she's doing. And there's cabinets in that room, and there's a plate and two cups and you can look outside the window you see a walkway you see grass you see another window with a curtain and in the window and the room that she's been has a curtain and there's a window. And I think that's it."
adrso021,64,0,0," everything you see going on in this picture? Ground safety hazards, as they're referred to in the military. The kid on the stool that's about to fall, and the woman sitting there blase while her sink runs over on the floor. I see the little girl, what is she asking for a cookie while her brother is falling down the stool? That's about it. Two accidents happening in the middle of two accidents happening here. She's standing in water so it's going to be slippery. She's liable to, besides the water running over the sink. It's kind of funny the way that sink's drawn, the way it looks like it's all splashing over the front. I don't really see anything else in the picture of significance. Am I supposed to see something else in the picture of significance? None of those hidden things. Where's the faces in the corner? No. So where's the faces in the corner? Uh... It looks like the typical pencil sketch of a domestic scene where everything goes wrong."
adrso022,67,1,0," And then here on this one, tell me everything you see going on in this picture. Well, I see the mother is not paying attention and her water is running over her sink. The boy has climbed up on a ladder to steal some cookies, and he's falling over. The girl is laughing. The grass is growing outside. Nobody seems to care. They're just going on with their daily activities. Anything else you see? No right or wrong answers, but is there anything else you see going on in the picture? No, not really."
adrso029,59,0,1," I'm going to show you a picture. And I want you to look at the picture. I want you to tell me everything that you see happening in the picture. Just tell me everything that you see going on. Now there's the picture. Look here mr toopy i see a part of the whole kitchen uh a lady in my kitchen in In our kitchen. Doing some work I suppose. And we have... There's another woman there sharing there. Pleasures or whatever. Okay. There it is. Have you took... heard of that new game that they started to play after Christmas? Yes, you were telling me about that, Mr. Toopey. Trivial Pursuit. Just tell me, do you see anything else happening in this picture here? What else do you see happening? What's going on there? Well, it looks like... I'd say this is, let's see what it's like. Bum-ba-dee, bum-, boo boo dee boo. My mother will beat me by, my wife will beat me by a couple of loads of this. What's happening over here Mr. Toupie? That's, that's like the washing machine. Let me see. Oh, that's the son's mountain school maybe or something. That's the youngster there. What's going on here? It's just as though they're getting ready to go to school or they're just coming home from school. Okay. And what's happening here? Right there is the same as back there, except for down here in the bottom I think it's that's a little separate. Okay."
adrso052,62,1,1," I want you to tell me anything that you see going on in that picture. What do you see? The cookie jar with the girl helping him. I think that isn't the right thing, but their mother was there, spilling the water. This wouldn't be the grandmother, I guess, it's the children. Okay, what is he's going to fall pretty quick. But she was helping. He handed the cookies to his sister, I guess. Well, it, uh, my mother was drying her dishes. She better get the water up. Anything else? Well, he might fall soon if he doesn't. He's careful. Is that it? I think so. Okay."
adrso053,64,0,1," And there it is. The chair is tilting. The lid is off of the cookie jar. The cookie in the left arm of the boy. His right hand is touching the cookie in the cookie jar. One of his feet is about a third off of the stool. He's got short pants and a blouse, and a seat, and they look like they're boots instead of shoes. The girl has a finger to her lips, so to say, quiet. One hand out, her left hand is out. She's got a short skirt and a blouse, jersey, sweater. Socks, anklets rather. I did mention that the store was tilting. Still on a boy, the boy's down on the store and it's tilting. I think I mentioned that. The girl has hair hanging to her neck. The boy has like short, like a hair comb straight back. The door jar is open on the cupboard. The mother's drying the dish with her dress or whatever it may be. Water spilling out of the sink. Two cups facing opposite direction. One plate to the right of the cups. Curtains flowing in the breeze of the wind. curtains flowing in the breeze of the wind Okay. There's still some more but That's about everything I think. Okay. There's still some more, but... That's about everything, I think."
adrso065,76,0,1," Let's go. Just tell you what they are. Ready? I don't know what you mean by everything going on. The kids snitching the cookies? Okay. The little girl, I think, is telling the little boy to be quiet because she's got to figure up to her manners. Mommy's kind of sloppy with the dishwater. It's running out of the sink. Take that for some of the together to sing. Mommy's standing in the water. Is that one of the things you want? Anything you find. Okay. The kid's just about ready to let go and fall on the back of his head. I don't know if it's okay? Like reaching up to the cookie or something? Uh-huh. Like reaching up to the cookie. Anything else? The kid brother's donating to her cause. I did say the sink over for one, didn't I? I don't see much more than that. I think the kid's following after all that stool. He's getting into the cookie jar, which he hadn't ought to do. Well, maybe he could. That's all he had done himself. OK. That's good. That's it. OK. Just like me."
adrso074,67,1,1," I see two kids up at a cookie jar, one on a stool, other standing on the floor. Cover door is opened, mother is washing the dishes, water is running overflowing the sink, and there's two cups and a plate on the counter, and she's washing, holding a plate in her hand. Curtains at the windows. The cookie jar has the lid off. That's about it. Cupboards underneath the sink, cupboards underneath the other cupboards. A kid falling off the stool. The girl laughing at him. Cookies in the cookie jar was lit off. He has a cookie in his hand. That's it. Okay, good."
adrso089,78,0,1," Well, they're stealing all the cookies. And the little girl is gonna take him one tour. He's gonna tell his mother. And the mother is working over there, doing all that dirty over there, then the kids should be doing their dishes. And that's dirty to have in on the floor when they're stealing and he's going to fall down and break them down on his back. And I don't think that his mother would be very nice to do that. They would rather have all you want because the water's all over the floor now, look at that. Get there and get down, oh bang, you're down on your back. Alright."
adrso093,79,0,1," Tell me what's going on in that picture. This little girl is talking to this boy up on this tupper ladder. And she's asking him to bring some of this down or whatever it was, a jar or whatever it is so it doesn't break. There's a mother over here. She's watching them. She has that break in her hand and it looks like it's a very strong break. She's looking real good at it, ajar or whatever. What else is going on over here? She's touching, giving a little touch of her mouth. That's right. All of that stuff that's there. Anything else? It looks like he's going to bring some of that down, down for them all.

I see that he is standing on a three-legged stool and he's about to depart from that three-legged stool. He has one cookie in his hand handed down to his sister and she's reaching up for it. And I think she's indicating to the boy to keep still so his mother doesn't hear what's going on. I see the mother, I guess she's drying the dishes and she's not paying attention because she's leaving the sink run over and spilling all over the floor. She must not be conscious because she's standing there and doesn't know it. I think she's probably looking out the window as I take the second look. I see apparently a couple of dirty dishes on the tabletop. I see the cupboards, I don't know whether they all have knobs on them or not. Doesn't look like the two with a boy and a girl have knobs on the cupboard door. And I see outside, I see up front it's a tree, some shrubbery and some hedges. Okay. That it. Okay, good."

His sister or girl is reaching up for a cookie and has her index finger or her right hand pointed upward close to her mouth. And maybe she's saying, shh, because they're going to have to be quiet because the stool is going to fall over. The boy has his right heel on his left toe. He's wearing running shoes with pom-poms on them. His socks looked pretty sloppy. I observed that one of the two slippers that the girl is wearing uh looks as if its sole is thicker than the one the left one is thicker than the right the woman is letting the sink run over, the water is running full tilt and overflowing the sink. She's drying a plate and she has a towel in her right hand and looks if she has something else. No, that's the curtain, the back end of the curtain that's behind her, the plate in her left hand. She has her left side to the window. She's already dried a plate and two cups. The window is open and you can see the path outside going around the back of the house and another room in the house, the woman is standing with her foot in the water, but not where it isn't, the water isn't running out of earth, but it's splashing up and the right shoe is in the water, puddle.

And there are a couple of bushes there. She must be drying the dishes. They look dried on the counter. The one in your hand, thought she'd just taken out. And then back there's a yard, a little sidewalk, and another wing of the house with a window and curtains curtains and a window above the sink which is nice, they've got their little walk-out I think she's a nice big bright red little wolf hog. I think that was a nice thing. Are you? She's so funny, I guess. Okay. That looks like I'm in. You did fine. That's great."
adrso288,59,1,0," I was in the sink I was drawing. My mother's doing the dishes. The children, the boy is up on the stool, and the stool is falling out of his grab and pooping bag. And the girl is reaching up. And the woman is standing in the water. They put each other in his or her own room. Thank you."
adrso296,69,1,0," Oh, the sink's running over. The water's gone all over the floor. Here, the boy, the step ladder's turning under his legs, and he's stealing cookies out of the cookie jar. And she's begging for cookies, the girl is. Coming back to the sink, let's see here. Mama's stepping in the water. I said the sink was running over. She's drying dishes. Wait a minute, what the devil is that? There's something, but I don't know what it is, written on the grass it seems. Oh, I never noticed that. I don't know. And the curtains. That's a pee pee something there. . . . I don't see anything else there. She's stepping in the water. The sink's running over. That's Bill's That spells something down there, but I can't see it. How am I made out so far in there? And he's on a stool that's gonna fall over while they're stealing cookies. And there's a plate and two cups on the sink and she's got a plate in her hand."

He's reaching for one for himself. He's handing one down to his sister. The three-legged stool is coming down with him. They're nicely dressed kids, but the boy needs his socks pulled up. That's all I see there mother I presume its mother is at the sink the water is running over out of the sink she's drying a dish she's looking out the window. There are two cups and a dish. I presume that's a dish that are already dried, I guess, and sitting on the side of the sink. Nicely groomed, nice curtains pulled back it's apparently somewhere outside because the window's open and it looks like shrubs are growing you can see a window in the other part of the house I presume that's still their house, and there's a driveway bordered with grass, and there's a tree out there somewhere that you can see part of the trunk and part of the foliage. And I see cabinets around the kitchen, other cabinets. And that's about it. Okay."

There is water coming out of a faucet into a basin which is overflowing onto the floor. Mother is drying dishes and she's walking in the water that is flowing on the floor two children are stealing cookies one of whom is up on a stool that is about to fall. He's removing cookies from an upper shelf in the closet. The wind appears to be blowing because the curtains appear to be, you know, puffed. And those are the only action things that I can"
