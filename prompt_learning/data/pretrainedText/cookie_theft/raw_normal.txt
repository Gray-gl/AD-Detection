well there's   a mother standing there washing the dishes and the sink is overflowing . and the window's open . and outside the window there's   a curved walk with a garden . and you can see another building there . looks like a garage or something with curtains and the grass in the garden . and there are two cups and a saucer on the sink . and she's   getting her feet wet from the overflow of the water from the sink . she seems to be oblivious to the fact that the sink is overflowing . she's   also oblivious to the fact that her kids are stealing cookies out of the cookie jar . and the kid on the stool is gonna   fall off the stool . he's   standing up there in the cupboard taking cookies out of the jar , handing them to a girl about the same age . the kids are somewhere around seven or eight years old or nine . and the mother is gonna   get shocked when he tumbles and the cookie jar comes down . and I think that's   about all .
somebody's   getting cookies out_of the cookie jar , standing on a stool . the stool's   gonna   tip over . and the girl's   saying "/. shh don't   let somebody hear . and the mother's   drying dishes . the water's   running out into the floor . cups and plates are sitting on the counter . you can look out the window and see the shrubbery . the lid's   sideways from the cookie jar . the door is open on the cabinet . mother apparently doesn't   really notice well enough . curtains are hanging on the window . the window is open .
okay . there's   a little boy and he's   standing on a stool that's   upsetting . and he's   getting a cookie and he's   sharing a cookie with the little girl who is shushing her mother with her finger and reaching for the cookie at the same time . on the ... what are the instructions ? just give as many details like /? action . or /. oh okay . the cupboard door is open . the stool is crooked . the water is splashing on the floor . the mother is stepping in it . she's   drying her dishes . the sink is overflowing . the cups and the saucers are there . the window is open and you see the lawn outside . and it must be summertime . they all have on short sleeves . and she's   wearing an apron . okay .
are you ready ? well the sink is overflowing . mother is standing in the water like a jerk . she's   wiping the dishes also like a jerk . the boy is trying to get a cookie out_of the cookie jar but boy he's   about to fall off the stool . his sister has her finger up to her mouth like she's   saying "/. shh . to be quiet ". don't   let mother know what you're   doing . and he's   about to hand her a cookie . but in a few moments it's   going to be like total catastrophe . the reason the water's   flowing out over the sink is because the water is running furiously . and I'm   looking out through the window . and I don't   see anything going on out there . I don't   //. that's   just a bush I'm   presuming or a plum pudding . I told you the stools about to go over . in a moment there's   going to be real chaos which will make what's   going on in the picture look like nothing . the cookie jar is full . the lid is off the cookie jar . and the //. do you want me to tell you all of those things ? the cabinet door has just swung open . stool is about to fall . I guess I've   just told you that . with a terrible crash . mother is daydreaming . she doesn't   even know what's   going on behind her . I think that's   very important and sometimes typical . seems to be all I can see .
okay . the mother's   washing the dishes and the sink is overflowing . she has some of them dried already on the side as she's   looking out the window while the little boy is falling off the stool because he's   getting into the cookie jar to give to his little sister who's   reaching up to get the cookie also . there's   water all over the floor . the garden is outside and the mother's   not paying any attention to what they do . the stool is tipping . the door is open . there may be a little breeze coming in because this window is open . the little girl has her finger to her mouth "/. shh we won't   tell mother while you give me the cookie . it's   in the kitchen of_course and two cups and a dish already have been dried . and the mother's stepping in the water and she's   probably so engrossed in what she's   doing outside she neither knows what the children are doing nor is she paying any attention that the water's overflowing .
okay . mother is drying the dishes but the water is going out over the sink onto the floor . it's   a pretty day outside . lots of flowers . there are three dishes left to dry I guess . she's   standing in the water . looks dangerous . the children are getting into the cookie jar . the boy's up there on the stool . and that's   almost falling over . he's   got one cookie in his hand . he's   handing it to the little girl . and he's   getting another one out_of the cookie jar cupboard . did you say action that is going on ? the little girl has her hand up to her mouth . looks like she's   trying to eat it or be quiet or she's   laughing . the mother doesn't   seem to be paying much attention . she looks like she's   looking out the window . the water is splashing onto the floor . that's   it .

the girl's   laughing at her brother because he went into the cookie jar and he's   falling over the cookie jar . and the mother was at the sink . and the water's   splashing over the sink . and she sort_of a little bit bitchy . and the water's   going flooding over the sink . and there's   a saucer , there's   a plate , there's   a couple of dishes . well and the mother's   looking out the window . she don't   know what the hell to think of it . a girl laughing at her brother who is taking cookies out_of the cookie jar and he's   ready to fall off the stool he's   on . the stool's crooked . what the hell else ? and then there's   a plate , saucer and two cups . she's   looking out the window . the window's open . she's   not paying any attention to the kids . the water's   flooding over the sink . what else you want ?
well the kids are in the corner . they are going to get some cookies from the cookie jar . and the mother does not see it because she's   inside drying the dishes . and the kids then just ... and I guess in the picture here that the mother that's   working hard and the kids were playing . and all of a sudden somebody turned over a dish . and all over the floor . except that it did not dry it up . it splashed from the sink but not from ... no that's   no . I'm   trying to get too much out_of it . and one of the kids is gonna   get a crack on the head . and maybe he has ... man ! it's   so ... sometimes I see it very clear and other times I see /. a weak image , so to speak . and sometimes I just have this p . what is in here now ? but mostly is I have not so much trouble in looking at a thing at it an image but not getting anything that you'll   want . but an etch you would say it in a little . !
okay . we see a little boy climbed up on a stool reaching for the cookie jar . and the stool is falling . he is trying to get a cookie for himself and also one for his sister . his sister is telling him to be very quiet . she's   going shh . can't   write that down . telling him to be quiet . and let's   see . in the meantime the mother is washing dishes and the sink has overflowed and is pouring water on the floor . I don't   think I see anything else . okay .
alright . I see the little boy stealing cookies from the cookie jar . and he gave some to the little girl and she's   eating some of the cookies . and I guess this is mama and she's   washing the dishes . and she dropped a dish . no she didn't   drop a dish . the water that she's   washing the dishes with she let run . and it's   overflown . that doesn't   sound right . did it /? we forgot to turn off the spigot . and so the water is running off onto the floor here . and mom apparently is washing the dishes . and here's   this little boy stealing the cookies . he's   gonna   fall because the four legged stool is gonna   fall over with him and the cookie jar . and mama's   drying the dishes as usual for mamas if they don't   have a husband that dries them or washes them or whatever . let's   see now . I guess there's   more things I'm   sposta   see . let's   see here now . oh and the water is flowing out of the sink they forgot to turn off whoever's doing the dishwashing . mom apparently here , she forgot to turn off the water and the water is spilling out onto the kitchen floor . and the little girl has pushed over the stool with the boy that was reaching up to get the cookies . either she pushed it over or he fell over with it . you_know it excuse me but you_know I was ...
there's   a little girl . and a little boy standing on top of a stool . and it looks like a mother maybe washing the dishes in the kitchen . there's   cookies in the jar up in the pantry I suppose . there's   two cups and a saucer or a plate maybe . there's   some shrubs outside . the sink is overflowing right now . and that's   about all . the sink is overflowing . the sink is overflowing . he's   trying to kill himself . you want more ? that's   it ?
a lady and her children . children . the lady is washing dishes . and ... okay . yeah . the children have cookies . the father isn't   coming . father didn't   come in yet . and the lady is getting it ready . get ... it's   a water with that . water went down . it's   gonna   fall over .
so she will find her . and the mother drying the dishes . and the stool's upset . you_know she's   getting the cookies . there's   cup and saucer setting there on a plate ready to eat . the cookie jar right here . that's   all I see /. and this is ... well whoever's   over there spilled it , knocked it down . I don't   know what that is . looks like a mouse . mhm .
mhm . oh I see a part of the whole kitchen . is that all the kitchen or isn't   it ? oh I can't   read ... a lady a mother were in her kitchen . in her kitchen doing some work I suppose . and there's   another woman there sharing their pleasures or whatever . oh have you heard of that new game that they started to play after christmas ? did you ? is a /. well it looks like ... I'd   say this is ... well let's   see . it looks like ... oh ... x x . my wife will beat me by a couple rows of this . that's   like the washing machine ? or let me see . I can't   ... oh â€?that's   the son come from school maybe or something . that's   a youngster there . well that's   just as though they getting ready to go to school or they're   just coming out from school . and right there he's   same as back there except for down there in the bottom I think it's   ... that's   a little .
the little boy is up on this thing here . and he's   up trying to get something out_of the garden selection I think it is . the little girl I think is mad because she didn't   get some of it . and here's   mama drying the dishes . no just the little girl and the boy was on here . the little girl and the boy . she's   reaching up to the boy and the boy got his other hand down . so ... it looks color /. no that's   all . oh she spilled something I think . from the sink down . it came splashing down . that's   the first I noticed it . I'm   terrible anymore .
well the children are climbing up and he's   about to fall . and he's   getting cookies . and she's   telling him to sh be quiet so mother won't   hear him getting up there . and he's   handing a cookie down to her . she's   washing the dishes . and for some reason she must have been upset about something because she is letting the water run out all over the place . I can't   believe she's   upset about the kids because she hasn't   seen them . maybe she did turn and look at them and then go back to the dishes . in other words it's   ... she's   deciding that if she did see them she's   deciding that she's   going to let them go ahead with it . but I don't   think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling . I think she would have turned . maybe dropped her dish . but she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from being harmed in the fall . and he might just pull all the cookie jar with him when he falls too . and with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor it would be a sad /. threesome and the kitchen would be a mess .
oh yes . a little girl and the little boy is getting cookies out_of the jar . oh and the stool is upsetting . and I guess it's   the mother is drying dishes . water's   spilling down all over the sink . water on the floor . little boy's gonna   fall and that there stool . I think the cookie jar is gonna   fall . and guess drying dishes and the faucet's   on and water's   running all over the floor . what ..? yeah . the cookie jar . the stool . her doing the dishes . the water spilling . yeah that's   as far as I could see .
and I will tell you what's   /. oh boy . well the little boy is reaching for a cookie . and his stool is falling over . and the little girl is begging him to give her one . and she's   pointing to her mouth . she wants to eat it . their mama is doing the dishes . the water's   running over the sink . that's   a mess . and then she's   not even looking at them . drying dishes . I think she's   looking out the window . it's   a nice yard out there . two cups and a dish finished . anything else ?
I see a tad bit . and somebody is drying dishes . no I can't   get this very well , clear . well someone's   standing on a stool and the stool is getting ready to fall over . well somebody's   drying dishes . no I don't   see anything else going on over here . I'm   thinking now maybe the water's overrunning . I'm   not too sure . there's   some water on the floor here . and there's   some in the sink that's   overrunning . .
an average home that looks very much like ours at many times . well she's   spilling her water which is not very good but she's   washing dishes and drying them . and one of the children upset the cookie jar . and that's   a very average thing to go on in a home . our home it's   a very active family . and so that it makes it kind_of hard at our house sometime because there's   like I said a_lot_of activity . well the poor girl is spilling the water on her feet . it's   gonna   be wet but then she'll   hafta   struggle with that . also there are a few more dishes left that didn't   get finished . this hasta   be the dishes . and how that little boy fell off that stool I don't   know but he did . no .
okay . there's   a boy is taking cookies and giving one to the girl imagine . and she wants one . I don't   know . the mother's   washing dishes . she spilled it . she's   washing dishes . and I can dance outside to you ? huh ? alright . oh ... oh he's   gonna   fall . and she's   laughing at them there . I don't   know what else . I don't   know .
taking some cookies . and falling over . and mother's   drying dishes . and things falling ... sink's   running over . and two cups and saucer on the sink . and ... and the girl's ... curtains on the windows . and the spigot's   on the sink . and ... well that's   about it .
the boy's   falling off the stool . the girl's   got her hand up . the lady's   drying dishes . the water is spilling on the floor . faucet's   on . the boy's   trying to get a cookie jar out . lid's   off of it . sink's   by the window . that's   all I know .
okay , I see a boy in the cookie jar . I see he has the lid off . I see that he is standing on a three legged stool and he's   about to depart from that three legged stool . he has one cookie in his hand , handing it down to his sister and she's   reaching up for it . and I think she's   indicating to the boy to keep still so his mother doesn't   hear what's   going on . I see the mother . I guess she's   drying the dishes and she's   not paying attention because she's   leaving the sink run over and it's   spilling all over the floor . and she must not be conscious because she's   standing in it and doesn't   know it . I think she's   probably looking out the window as I take the second look . and I see apparently a couple dirty dishes on the tabletop . I see the cupboards . I don't   know whether they all have knobs on them or not . doesn't   look like the two where the boy and the girl are have knobs on the cupboard door . and I see outside . I see apparently it's   a tree , some shrubbery and some hedges . about it ?

oh it's   the same picture . you should give me a different one . why ? it would be more fun if you had some variety . okay . we have here a scene in a kitchen and it looks as though that's   a mama who is working at the sink and her two children . and the two children are hoping that mama will not notice because she's   looking out the window that they are getting into the cookie jar . so the boy climbs up on a stool to reach the cookie jar . and as he's   getting up there the stool is tilting and he looks as though he were about to fall over . and the little girl is telling him to be quiet by putting her finger on her lips . he has one cookie in his hand , is reaching for another one . the lid is off the cookie jar . the cupboard door is open . he's   supposedly going to hand one cookie , it looks as though he is , to his sister and grab another one for himself but I doubt that he's   gonna   get all that done before the stool falls over . around the corner of the kitchen there's   a counter that sort_of turns a corner . there are cupboards below the counter and above the counter where the cookies are . then when you get over and have turned a corner in the kitchen you have base cabinets and then you have a window above that which is looking out into something which makes it looks as though it's   summer outside because the window is open . there are things growing out there . there's   a walk . there's   some shrubbery underneath another window that looks it's   in a another wing of the house . there's   a tree beyond . there are tie back curtains at the window . the mother is working at the sink and the faucet is left on and apparently there's   no overflow in the sink so it's   overflowing right onto the floor splash . and she has on a sleeveless dress which also indicates that it's   summer . and it looks though she has an apron on . she has short hair . she is drying a plate with a tea towel . beside the sink there are two cups and a plate . looks as though there's   some suds and some dishes in the sink . and two faucets with x type handles one on either side and a center faucet . she has shoes on with no ties , just sort of slipon shoes . there's   a little scallop valance across the top of the curtains . I think that's   all I'm   gonna   tell you . well â€?the handles on the door are the kind that are just almost like a round piece of wood that you hafta   get a hold of to pull the cupboard door open . and what's   really strange is that you can't   see any handles on the cupboards on the other side of the kitchen .
the poor mom's   getting her feet wet because she thinking of days gone by and then the water run . and that boy whether he knows or not he's   gonna   crack his head on the back of that counter trying to get too many cookies out . I don't   know the significance of that little girl putting her hand to her mouth reaching . unless that's   the way all silly girls act at that age . pardon ? oh sure . there's   no handles on the cabinet drawers under the counter on the left side . and over in the window you see through the kitchen window all the styles are not in the glass . and if the kitchen window's   the same type of window as well the other part of the house the style's   only in the upper and the laterals . maybe they build them that way . no , but I did notice that's   a_little I wouldn't   say unusual but . pardon ? I said that the sink was overflowing . the mother's   getting her feet wet . the boy's   going to fall very hard and hurt himself . and nobody's gonna   help him . well happening ... did I say the cabinet doors where the kids are have no handles on them ? oh â€?there's   got to be a dozen other things . responsible ? well I'll   tell you the way mom is looking there's   not much going on in her head . she's   thinking of dad . and the little girl is saying "/. sh don't   tell mom . the conflict's in what she's   thinking whereas she didn't   know the kids are behind her . and did I say ..? . the cabinet doors are different sizes . have no handles . I guess you take a big sledge hammer to that .
well the little boy is stealing cookies and giving it to his friend or sister . he's   partially gonna   fall off the stool . his sister is telling him to be quiet . the mother is washing dishes . and the water is overflowing onto the floor and she's   standing in a puddle and has a smile on her face .
well the sink is running over . she's   drying the dishes . they're   getting in the cookie jar and they're   upsetting the stool . the girl is reaching for a cookie . the lady here's   standing right in the water . she seems to be looking out the window at the lawn . that's   about it right /.
I see this woman who's   standing by the sink washing dishes and the water's   spilling out over the sink . and I see this little boy standing on a stool reaching for cookies and he looks like he's   ready to fall . as far as action goes I don't   know if I see any more action in there at all .
it's   a family affair , a mother and the children . and they're   each busy at something . and they seem oblivious to the water overflowing . but they seem happy in doing their own thing . I lost that . I think I ...
well the little girl is reaching for a cookie . and the boy is on a stool which is falling over to get in the cookie jar up on the second shelf of the cupboard with the door open . the faucet is running and it's   overflowing onto the floor because it's   overflowing into the sink . the woman is drying a plate . she's   also looking out the window . there's   a couple of bowls and a plate on the counter . curtains at the windows . there's   a driveway or it looks like a driveway outside . and you can see another window and some bushes out there and the tree . and looks like a window of the garage out there . and the cookie jar has the lid off . and the boy has one hand in the cookie jar and one with a cookie in it handing to the little girl who's   got her hand up for it and she looks like got her finger to mouth tell him to be careful .
